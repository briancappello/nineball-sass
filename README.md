# super-skeleton

Yet *another* front-end framework. It's an extended version of [Seth Coelen's](https://github.com/WhatsNewSaes) [Skeleton-Sass](https://github.com/WhatsNewSaes/Skeleton-Sass), which itself is the (un)official Sass version of [Dave Gamache's](https://github.com/dhg) [Skeleton Framework](http://getskeleton.com). Those authors deserve the vast majority of the credit. Like their versions, super-skeleton is also licensed under the MIT license.

Whereas Skeleton is intended to be a "starting point", super-skeleton tries to be a bit closer to a light-weight UI framework.

-----

Skeleton is a simple, responsive boilerplate to kickstart any responsive project.

Check out <http://getskeleton.com> for documentation and details.

## Getting started

### Install
  * [Download zip](https://github.com/briancappello/super-skeleton/archive/master.zip), clone the repo, or `npm install super-skeleton [--save]` from your terminal

### What's in the download?

The download includes Skeleton's CSS, ~~Normalize CSS as a reset,~~ and a sample favicon.

```

### Contributions
If you have improvements, additional mixins, or other helpful Sass techniques that do not add significant bloat, please feel free to make a pull request!

### Why it's awesome

Skeleton is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more.  

- Minified, it's less than a kb
- It's a starting point, not a UI framework
- ~~No compiling or installing...just vanilla CSS~~


## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest
- Safari latest
- IE latest

The above list is non-exhaustive. Skeleton works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.
